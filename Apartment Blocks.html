            <h2 class="apartment-subheading">What Qualifies as an Apartment Building?</h2>
            <p class="apartment-paragraph">
                One common question we get from sellers is, “Does my property qualify as an apartment building?” While there are many types of multifamily properties, most of them fall under the broad definition of an “apartment building.” This term generally refers to any larger structure divided into separate residences. These buildings may go by various names depending on the region, such as “apartment block,” “apartment complex,” or “condominiums.”

        <!-- Evolution of Apartment Buildings Section -->
        <div class="apartment-evolution-box">
            <h2 class="apartment-subheading">The Evolution of Apartment Buildings</h2>
            <p class="apartment-paragraph">
                The concept of apartment living dates back to ancient Rome, where multi-family buildings known as “insula” housed large numbers of residents. During the industrial revolution, apartment blocks became common in cities, providing affordable housing for the growing workforce. Over time, apartment living has evolved to offer more comfort, style, and convenience, meeting the needs of diverse populations in various settings.<br>

Today’s apartment buildings range from low-rise suburban buildings to high-rise urban towers, and even mixed-use complexes with residential units above retail spaces. Each type serves a specific demographic and meets distinct needs, whether in a bustling city center or a quiet suburban area.

                    <h3>Low-Rise Apartments</h3>
                    <p>These smaller buildings, typically 2-4 stories high, are often found in suburban areas where they blend well with single-family homes. They may house anywhere from four to eight units or more.</p>

                <div class="apartment-tile">
                    <h3>High-Rise Apartments</h3>
                    <p>Found primarily in urban centers, high-rise apartment buildings can soar over 30 stories, accommodating hundreds of units. These structures are ideal for high-density areas and often come with advanced amenities and conveniences.</p>

                <div class="apartment-tile">
                    <h3>Mixed-Use Apartments</h3>
                    <p>Common in downtown areas, mixed-use buildings combine residential units with commercial spaces on the ground floor. This setup appeals to residents who enjoy the convenience of nearby shops, restaurants, and services.</p>
